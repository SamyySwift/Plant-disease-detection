This repo contains all the codes, documnets and links for my KaggleX final project which was on "Enhancing Agriculture through Computer Vision-Based Plant Disease Detection"

## 🎯Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an innovative solution that leverages computer vision technology to revolutionize the way farmers detect and manage plant diseases. Our primary objective is to empower farmers with a timely and accurate tool for identifying plant diseases in their crops, thereby facilitating early intervention and minimizing crop loss.
